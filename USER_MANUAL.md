# User Manual: Revenue Cycle Intelligence Dashboard

## 1. Introduction
Welcome to **Revenue Cycle Intelligence**, an AI-powered analytics platform designed for Hospital CFOs and Revenue Cycle Directors. This tool bridges the gap between raw financial data and actionable executive insights by combining a high-performance KPI engine with the power of the Claude AI agent.

## 2. Key Modules

### 📈 Dashboard
The central hub for real-time monitoring.
- **KPI Cards**: View 12 core revenue cycle metrics. Each card shows the current value, a trend comparison vs. the previous period, and your facility's ranking in industry benchmarks (e.g., "75th percentile").
- **Trend Charts**: Interactive Plotly charts show monthly collection rates and denial patterns.
- **Anomaly Alerts**: Threshold-based alerts that highlight unusual spikes in denial rates or delays in A/R.
- **AI Executive Summary**: A natural-language summary generated by Claude that interprets the raw data for you.

### 💬 AI Query Console
Ask your data questions in plain English.
- **How to use**: Type queries like *"What is our denial rate for BCBS in Q4?"* or *"Compare collections for the last two quarters."*
- **Heuristic Engine**: If an API key isn't provided, safe mock responses are generated to demonstrate data connectivity.
- **Suggested Queries**: Use the sidebar "chips" for ideas on what to ask.

### ⚖️ Benchmark Comparison
See how you stack up against the competition.
- **Profile Config**: Set your hospital type (Community, Rural, etc.) and bed count.
- **Peer Comparison**: Compare your metrics against HFMA 2024 medians (25th, 50th, 75th, 90th percentiles).
- **AI Gap Analysis**: Detailed recommendations on how to bridge performance gaps (e.g., "Reducing A/R days by 5 would improve cash flow by $1.2M").

### 📋 Report Generator
Produce board-ready deliverables in seconds.
- **Selection**: Choose from templates like the **Board Deck** (PPTX).
- **Configuration**: Filter by date range and payer before generating.
- **Download**: Once the agent builds the deck, a download button will appear.

### ⚙️ Data Management
Control your data source and monitor quality.
- **Refresh**: Trigger a manual sync from your source CSV or Google Sheet.
- **Quality Report**: View validation findings, missing values, and normalization status.
- **Raw Preview**: Inspect the top 100 rows of your processed financial data.
